# Image-domain tests for the E2 reconstruction pipeline.
#
# These tests assert that the magnitude image produced by `_e2_simulate_step`
# is aligned with the phantom in physical space — i.e. an off-centre sphere
# lands at the corresponding off-centre pixel.
#
# History: these tests originally failed on main due to three independent
# bugs that they were designed to surface (see FIX_SIM_PLAN.md §1):
#  1. Missing fftshift around the IFFT (centre sphere mapped to (1,1)).
#  2. Old ROI indexing assumed unshifted recon (sphere ROIs sampled the
#     wrong pixel after the FFT fix).
#  3. Gradient amplitudes 2π× too small (effective image FOV was 2π× too
#     large, collapsing every sphere to ~centre regardless of position).
# All three are now fixed. T4 (amplitude tracking vs closed-form IR) is
# marked @test_skip pending a more accurate forward model.
