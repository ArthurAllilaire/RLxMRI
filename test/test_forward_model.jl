# Forward models: the band-limiting operator (`bandlimit_image`) and the two
# IR-SE forward models. Core claims under test:
#   1. central_crop is symmetric about DC and bounds-checked.
#   2. bandlimit_image conserves total intensity (Σ image == Σ fine), returns a
#      real image for real input, and is a no-op when crop size == input size.
#   3. bandlimit_image removes high-frequency (out-of-band) content — the moiré
#      mechanism — while preserving a smooth (in-band) field.
#   4. ir_se_theory_image gives a far smoother uniform region than the naive
#      ir_se_theory_image_binned (the whole point of the band-limited model),
#      while conserving total signal.
